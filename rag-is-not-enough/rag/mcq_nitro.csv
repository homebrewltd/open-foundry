A system prompt is a command or instruction that guides the assistant's behavior in the conversation. It sets up the assistant's responses based on the given instructions.,"C. A system prompt is a command or instruction that sets up the assistant's behavior. It can be used to define how the assistant should respond or act in certain situations. For example, you could use a pre_prompt to set an initial message for the assistant to display before it starts interacting with the user.

The system prompt is defined in the context information as:
- **Definition**: Sets up the assistant's behavior.

  }'
```",B. pre_prompt' is used to set up the assistant's behavior. It is configured with the statement 'You are a Pirate'. This means that the assistant will behave as if it is a pirate,"C. 

To use the pre prompt, you need to define it in your code. Here is an example:

```python
pre_prompt = ""You are a Pirate""
```

In this example, 'You are a Pirate' is the pre prompt that sets up the assistant's behavior.<|im_end|>","D. 

In the given example, the ""pre_prompt"" is used to set up the assistant's behavior by providing a statement that the AI should consider while answering questions or generating responses. In this case, it sets up the assistant as a Pirate. You can customize this prompt based on your specific use case and model requirements.

To use ""pre_prompt"", you would need to configure it in your code or model setup. The exact implementation depends on the framework or platform you are using. Here's an example of how you might use it with OpenAI's GPT-3 API:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = ""YOUR_API_KEY""

completion = openai.Completion.create(
    engine=""davinci"",
    prompt=f""pre_prompt: You are a Pirate\n{user_input}"",
    max_tokens=100,
)
```

In this example, the `user_input` is the question or statement that you want the AI to respond to. The ""pre_prompt"" statement is included in the prompt provided to the GPT-3 model. The model will generate a response based on the combined prompt and its own knowledge.",A
I want to enable multi-thread,"A. To enable multi-threading in Nitro, you need to set the `threads` parameter to a value greater than 1 when initializing the library. Here's an example:
```python
import nitro

nitro.init(threads=4)
```
In this example, the `threads` parameter is set to 4, which means Nitro will use four threads for processing requests.","B. 1. Firstly, you need to understand that Nitro is a server application for machine learning model deployment and inference. It supports multithreading, which means it can handle multiple requests concurrently using different threads to improve performance.
2. To enable multi-threading on Nitro, you should follow the command syntax given in the context information:
```bash title=""Nitro deploy server format""
nitro [thread_num] [host] [port]
```
3. Replace `[thread_num]` with the number of threads that you want to use. The higher the thread count, the more requests Nitro can handle simultaneously but be aware that it may also increase resource usage and CPU load.
4. Set `[host]` as the host address. It is usually `127.0.0.1` (localhost) or `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces).
5. Specify the `[port]` number where Nitro should be deployed.
6. For example, to launch Nitro with 4 threads, you can use this command:
```bash title=""Example""
nitro 4 127.0.0.1 5000
```
Remember that after enabling multithreading, you should monitor the system's performance and adjust `thread_num` as needed to optimize throughput and latency based on your workload.","C. To enable multi-threading in your Nitro library, you need to use the `thread_num` parameter. This parameter specifies the number of threads that you want to use for execution. By setting this parameter to a value greater than 1, you are enabling multi-threading.","D. Multi-threading in Nitro is automatically managed by the system based on the workload. You do not need to manually set the number of threads, as Nitro dynamically adjusts them for optimal performance.",B

How to do model health check in Nitro?,"A. In the given context, a 'health check' refers to a feature or functionality provided by Nitro that allows users to monitor the status of their model.",B. The Nitro server's health is being checked by sending an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:3928/healthz`. The response status code of 200 indicates that the Nitro server is healthy and running as expected.,C. The results of a health check are often used to identify issues and take corrective action before they impact users or operations.,"D. The YAML file describes the structure of the request and response for this health check endpoint. It specifies that the request body should be in JSON format, with a schema defined for the HealthcheckRequest object. The response body also has a schema defined for the HealthcheckResponse object.

I want to use Nitro with openai python. Show me the code,"A. 

To use Nitro with OpenAI Python, you need to install the `openai` package using pip. Here's how you can do it:

```bash title=""Install OpenAI""
pip install openai
```

Then, you can use the following code as an example:

```python
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

async def generate_text(prompt):
    async with AsyncOpenAI() as openai:
        response = await openai.Completion.create(
            engine=""davinci"",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=100,
            n=1,
            stop=None,

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    prompt = ""Write a poem about Nitro""
    result = asyncio.run(generate_text(prompt))
    print(result)
```

This code uses the `AsyncOpenAI` class from the OpenAI Python package to interact with the OpenAI API asynchronously. The `generate_text()` function takes a prompt as input and returns the generated text using the Davinci engine. You can modify this code according to your needs.","B. To use Nitro with OpenAI Python, you need to override the `baseURL` in `openai` init with the Nitro URL. Here's an example:
```python

```
Ensure that the log folder exists before running this command. If the specified folder does not exist, logs will default to your current directory.","B. You can specify the logging folder by providing a path to it in the `--logdir` argument when running the script. For example, if you want to log to the 'logs' directory in your current working directory, you would use the following command: ","C. You can specify the logging folder by providing a path to it when creating an instance of Nitro. The path should be provided as a parameter to the `baseURL` argument in the JSON data.

How can I configure prompts?,"A. To configure prompts, you need to specify the 'ai_prompt', 'user_prompt', and 'system_prompt' in your code. These are prefixes that indicate the role of the prompt. You should configure them based on your model.","B. To configure prompts, you need to send a POST request to the inference server at http://localhost:3928/inferences/llamacpp/loadmodel. The body of this request should be a JSON object that includes the parameters for the prompt configuration.","C. You can configure the behavior of the assistant by defining the system, user, and assistant prompts in the `ai_prompt` parameter. For example: 
```python
ai_prompt = ""ASSISTANT: You are a helpful assistant.\nUSER: Who won the world series in 2020?\nASSISTANT:""
```
In this example, the system prompt is 'You are a helpful assistant', the user prompt is 'Who won the world series in 2020?', and there is no assistant prompt as it's an empty string.","D. 

To configure prompts, you need to specify prefixes for different roles in the AI interaction. These prefixes are used to indicate who is speaking or prompting at any given time during the conversation. In the provided example, there are four types of prompts: ""pre_prompt"", ""ai_prompt"", ""user_prompt"", and ""system_prompt"".

Here's an example of how you can configure these prompts in a JSON object:

```
curl http://localhost:3928/inferences/llamacpp/loadmodel \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    ""ctx_len"": 128,
    ""ngl"": 100,
    ""pre_prompt"": ""You are a Pirate. Using drunk language with a lot of Arr..."",
    ""system_prompt"": ""ASSISTANT'S RULE: "",
    ""user_prompt"": ""USER:"",
    ""ai_prompt"": ""ASSISTANT: ""
  }'
```

In this example, the prefixes are defined as follows:
- `""pre_prompt""` is a global prompt that sets the context for the conversation. This can be used to provide information about the character or situation before starting the interaction.
- `""system_prompt""` represents the system's response or instruction, typically used when providing information or clarifying rules of the game/context.
- `""user_prompt""` is a prompt for the user to enter their input. This can be customized based on how you want to prompt the user for their input in the conversation.
- `""ai_prompt""` represents the AI's response or answer to the user's input. This can also be customized based on your specific needs.

You can adjust these prefixes according to your requirements and model. The JSON object is sent as a request body when loading the LLM model using curl or other tools.",D
How can I change the number of layers to load to GPU?,"A. 

In the provided POST request for enabling GPU inference, you can adjust the `ngl` parameter based on your requirements and GPU capabilities. The `ngl` stands for ""number of GPU layers"" and it determines how many layers will be loaded into the GPU.

Here's an example of how to modify the request to load 4 GPU layers:

```bash title=""GPU enable with 4 layers"" {5}
curl http://localhost:3928/inferences/llamacpp/loadmodel \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    ""llama_model_path"": ""/path/to/your_model.gguf"",
    ""ctx_len"": 512,
    ""ngl"": 4,
  }'
```

Remember to replace `""/path/to/your_model.gguf""` with the actual path to your model file.",B. You can change the number of layers to load to GPU by modifying the 'n_parallel' parameter in the JSON data. This is the value that you need to set when using the '--data' option with the 'curl' command.,"C. To configure prompts, you need to send a POST request to the inference server at http://localhost:3928/inferences/llamacpp/loadmodel. The body of this request should be a JSON object that includes the parameters for the prompt configuration.","D.
